1. NoSQL database is a database management system that can support structured, semi-structured and unstructured data, while
providing horizontal scalability performance and high availability. It provides faster data ingestion.
Example: in terms of unstructured data, there is no need to define schema, which means any data (web pages, audio and video,
metadata etc) can be stored and analyzed.


2. NoSql Database differ in how they store data.
a. Column Based databases have storage blocks that each contain data belonging to only one column; examples include: HBase and
Cassandra.
b. Document Based databases store documents made up of tagged elements; examples include MongoDB and CouchDB.
c. A Graph-based database is a network database that uses edges and nodes to represent and store its data; and example is Neo4J.
d. Key-Value Databases use a big hash table of key value pairs; examples include Dynamo and Riak.


3. CAP Theorem has the notion that any database may have only up to 2 of these 3 features: Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance.
Examples:
RDBMSs offer only Availability and Consistency.
Dynamo & HBase offer Consistency and Partition Tolerance.
CouchDB and Riak offer Availability and Partition Tolerance.

4. HBase has a Master-Slave setup. The Master servers consist of NameNode, ZooKeeper and HMaster, and the Slave servers consist
of Region Servers and DataNodes.

5. Here are some differences between HBase and RDBMS
HBase stores data in a column oriented fashion, while RDBMS stores data in rows.
HBase is optimized for aggregation tasks because it’s column oriented and the columns of each column family share some values,
while RDBMS is optimized for single row reads and writes.
HBase applies compression techniques on the data which makes it prefered for larger rows and columns, where as RDBMS is more
suited for relatively less rows and columns.
HBase doesn’t require schema while RDBMS does.
